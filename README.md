# Sigma - A Lightweight Go Web Framework

## Overview
Sigma is a minimal, custom-built web framework written in Go, designed for creating dynamic, real-time web applications. It combines server-side rendering, component-based architecture, and Server-Sent Events (SSE) to deliver live updates with simplicity and control.

## Purpose
Sigma aims to provide a straightforward way to:
- Serve dynamic HTML from the server using Goâ€™s templating.
- Manage application state with reusable components.
- Push real-time updates to the browser via SSE.
- Handle routing and user interactions in a lightweight way
